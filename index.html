                <p class="para">
                    The Hindu God Shiva (Sanskrit: Auspicious One), or Siva, is one of the main Deities of Hinduism,
                     worshiped as the paramount lord by the Saivite sects of India. Shiva is one of the most complex gods of India,
                      embodying seemingly contradictory qualities. He is the destroyer and the restorer, 
                    the great ascetic and the symbol of sensuality, the benevolent herdsman of souls and the wrathful avenger.
                    <br>
                     The Hindu God Shiva was originally known as Rudra,
                    a minor deity addressed only three times in the Rig Veda.
                    He gained importance after absorbing some of the characteristics of an earlier fertility god and became Shiva,
                     part of the trinity, or trimurti, with Vishnu and Brahma.
                    <br>
                    Shaivism, or Saivism, is one of the most popular Hindu cults. It embraces many theological practices,
                     although all agree on three principles: pati. or God; pasu, or individual soul; and pasa, or bonds that confine the soul
                      to earthly existence. The aim of Shaivites is to rid their souls of bondage and achieve shivata, 
                      the "nature of Shiva". They achieve this through ascetic practices and penances, with an emphasis on yoga and renunciation.
                       Many Shaivites become wandering sadhus, or hold men. Shiavites mark their foreheads with three horizontal marks
                        representing the three aspects of Shiva.

        <p class="sutras">
        Shiva Sutras are a collection of seventy seven aphorisms that form the foundation of the tradition of spiritual mysticism known as Kashmir Shaivism. They are attributed to the sage Vasugupta of the 9th century C.E.[1][2][3]

Vasugupta is said to have lived near Mahadeva Mountain in the valley of the Harvan stream behind what are now the Shalimar Gardens near Srinagar. One myth is that he received the aphorisms in a dream visitation of a Siddha or semi-divine being. Another is that Lord Shiva came to him in a dream and instructed him to go to a certain rock on which he would find the teachings inscribed.[4] This rock called Shankaropala is still visited by devotees. The other theory is that Lord Shiva taught the Siva-Sutras to Vasugupta in a dream. Whatever the truth is these myths point to the traditional belief that the Shiva sutras are of Philosophical origin or revelation and are surely a very great product of Sanatana Dharma.

Historically the Shiva Sutras and the ensuing school of Kashmir Shaivism are a Tantric or Agamic tradition. The Tantrics saw themselves as independent of the Vedic mainstream schools of thought and practice, and as beyond the rules that had been put in place by them.

A number of commentaries were written by Vasugupta's contemporaries or successors. Most famous of them is Kshemaraja's Vimarshini (10th Century C.E.) which has been translated into English by Jaideva Singh and Swami Lakshman Joo. Another is a commentary called the Varttika by Bhaskara (11th century C.E.) which has been translated into English by Dr. Mark Dyczkowski.[5]

There are many translations of the Shiva Sutras into English. A painstaking Italian translation of the Sutras and the Kshemaraja's Vimarshini by Raffaele Torella is also available. Demetrios Th. Vassiliades translated the Shiva Sutras with the Kshemaraja's Vimarshini into Greek.[6] Kriya yogi. The latest most authoritative treatise on the Sutras is by Gerard D. C. Kuiken.[7]

The Fifth Guru of Kriya yoga (Babaji's lineage), Shailendra Sharma gave yogic commentaries to Shiva Sutras in 1993.[8] In 2014 new translation of Shiva Sutras into English has been made available along with innovative commentary organized into chapters called cascades [9]

The soul power of Shiva Sutras of Vasugupta is that the yogi experiences both internal and external awareness of the Divine. His consciousness transcends into sublime awareness of each minute particle of the universe so that all the seemingly mystic to others seems totally innate to him.</p>
